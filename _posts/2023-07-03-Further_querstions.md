  - What is the relationship between the servers and the pool?
- Agent and handler numbers: Are these in different departments?
  - Can we add the team names to agents?

- What is the SLA of the different queues?
- What are the incentives to conform to the SLAs?
  - Any type of bonus that they dont get or so?
  - Is that on a individual or on a server-pool basis? or a mixture?
 
- What happens end-to-end when a customer calls CS?
 
- Can we differentiate the problem types/codes?
  - How reliable is errand_type?
 
- Who is calling in? Only tech responsible/owners? or also employees of the enterprise customers?
